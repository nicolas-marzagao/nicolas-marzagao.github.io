    <p>Welcome to my home, my safe haven. The place that I can experiment, document, teach and just have some fun with what I enjoy. This is where I will mostly post thing that I am learning and doing with my code. I'm also planing on writing a cuple of tutorials for people who are stating out in this area, maybe some stuff about older programming languanges which are my favourite.<p>

    
    <p>Anyway if you would like to read some random stuff written by a Brazilian Computer Science student you have come to the right place.<p>
