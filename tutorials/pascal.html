    <p>Today I was thinking on what to write my first tutorial on then I realized that most people in 2024 have never programed in pascal which to be fair is quite normal, I mean its an old languange and a part from a few niche projects I don't think anyone is actually writing code with it. So today I'll be teaching you some basic pascal.<p>

    <p>Feel free to jump around in this Tutorial, it is project based but each project is isolated from each other so skiping some won't be a problem.</p>
   
    <h3>Why Learn Pascal?</h3>

    <p>Honestly just for the fun of it, pascal is an old languange with a pretty interesting syntax that you dont really see now a days, another reason is that most older academic computer science books use pascal so if you ever need to pick one up you won't be complely lost. But by far the best reason is that learning programming languanges is a skill, the more practice you have with that skill the better you become. Learning pascal will not get you a job at Google, but it's good practice and (in my opinion) fun!<p>

    <h3>Who is this Tutorial not for?</h3>

    <p>Programmers who are just getting started, a mean if you just learned how loops work in Python,  learning a completly new language (and one that is not similar to most modern ones) is problably a bad idea. But if you really want to who am I to stop you?</p>

    <h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>

    <p>To learn Pascal we will be building some projects, staring with a basic guessing game.</p>

    <h3>Projects & Topics</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Hello World! (Have a quick look please)</li>
        <p>Not really a project, but here I will talk about what we will be using for the next up comming projects</p>
        <li>Guess The Number Game</li>
        <p>In this project we will learn basic conditional statements and loops.</p> 
    </ol>
